This repository contains (bare-bones) pure numpy implementations in the scikit-learn API format of the following basic Machine Learning algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - kNN
  - kMeans
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient-boosted Trees

Some scikit-learn examples of these examples are also provided in the `scikit-examples` folder.
